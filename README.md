# Command Line Task Manager
Hello and welcome to our group's first OOP Project!

We have implemented a command line task management tool to help you organize your team's work. 
You can do so by applying our simple list of commands. 

# Design 
Tasks are afraid to exist in the void, without belonging to a board. In order to be kind to them, you will need to first create the boards you later intend to populate with tasks.
Currently, relocating them to new boards is not possible, so choose wisely and plan accordingly! 

You can create 3 types of jobs: *Bug*, *Feedback* and *Story*.

It is possible to create a task with and without an assignee, but at any point in time they can belong to only one person. 
If later you decide to change the one responsible for them, you need to first remove the current appointee.
